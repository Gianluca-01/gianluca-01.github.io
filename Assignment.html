<h1> <strong>Minimilism in illustration</strong></h1>
<br>

    demonstrate these then in <strong>flat lay design?</strong>

    <p><em>The main inspiration for this assignment were</em></p>

<ul>
    <li>Te' fit-tazza</li>
    <li>Torri</li>
    <li>Malta doors</li>
</ul>



<p>These 3 artists really set a bar for all the students, they might have a minimal approach but this doesn't mean that 
    they are any less difficult. As for our own illustration we set out to shoot some doors ourselves as references to what
we will be doing. It's very interesting when you start to notice all these different styles of facades 
we have on this island.</p>
